# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-TensorFlow-A-Convolutional-Neural-Network-Approach
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a widely used dataset for machine learning and computer vision research, containing 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks. The project covers the entire workflow, from data loading and preprocessing to model building, training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision, where the goal is to categorize images into predefined classes. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks due to their ability to capture spatial hierarchies in images. In this project, we utilize TensorFlow, a powerful open-source library for machine learning, to build a CNN that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
Dataset
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images.

To load the CIFAR-10 dataset, we use TensorFlow's datasets module:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras import datasets

(train_images, train_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = datasets.cifar10.load_data()
Model Architecture
We build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow's Sequential API. The model consists of:

Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation
Max pooling layers to reduce dimensionality
A flattening layer to convert 2D matrices into a 1D vector
Two dense (fully connected) layers
A final output layer with 10 units (one for each class) and no activation (using logits)
Here is the model architecture:

python
Copy code
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models

model = models.Sequential([
    layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(32, 32, 3)),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2)),
    layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu'),
    layers.Flatten(),
    layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(10)
])
Training the Model
We compile the model with the Adam optimizer, sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function, and accuracy as the evaluation metric. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a batch size of 32.

python
Copy code
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss=tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy(from_logits=True),
              metrics=['accuracy'])

history = model.fit(train_images, train_labels, epochs=10, 
                    validation_data=(test_images, test_labels))
Evaluating the Model
After training, we evaluate the model on the test dataset to determine its accuracy.

python
Copy code
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels, verbose=2)
print(f'Test accuracy: {test_acc}')
Results
The training and validation accuracy over the epochs can be visualized using Matplotlib:

python
Copy code
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.plot(history.history['accuracy'], label='accuracy')
plt.plot(history.history['val_accuracy'], label='val_accuracy')
plt.xlabel('Epoch')
plt.ylabel('Accuracy')
plt.ylim([0.5, 1])
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.show()
Usage

Conclusion
This project showcases the power of Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification tasks. By leveraging TensorFlow, we efficiently built, trained, and evaluated a CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset, achieving a good level of accuracy. This project can be extended by experimenting with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and data augmentation techniques to further improve performance.
